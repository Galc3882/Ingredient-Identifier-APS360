### Invalid Ingredients Analysis
- The most common words in invalid ingredients include measurements and generic terms like `-`, `1`, `half`, `and`, `2`, `all-purpose`, `flour`, etc. This suggests that many invalid ingredients might be improperly formatted or include non-ingredient descriptors like quantities and types of ingredients (e.g., "all-purpose flour").
- **Top Words:** The top words in invalid ingredients, aside from numbers and common terms like "and" or "half," are related to measurements (`cup`, `teaspoon`) and generic ingredients (`flour`, `spice`, `powder`), indicating that part of the invalid ingredients might be due to including measurements or non-specific terms within the ingredient list.
